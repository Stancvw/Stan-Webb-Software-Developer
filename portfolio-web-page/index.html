            <h2>About Me:</h2>
            <br>
            <p>As someone who loves computers and math, I've always wanted to get into the programming industry.</p>
            <br>
            <p> As a father of five, I've worked countless blue collar jobs in order to take care of my family. I've
                learned many things
                about customer service, problem solving, and team leading. Now that I have an opportunity to pursue a
                career I'd be passionate with
                about, I'm excited to join a team of like-minded developers. I think my past experiences will prove
                useful not only in coding, but in
                working with others to solve problems.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Currently, I am enrolled in <a href="https://www.thinkful.com" target="_blank">Thinkful</a> coding
                bootcamp for web development. My true passion lies in video games, and I'm hoping this career choice will lead me down the path of video game design.
